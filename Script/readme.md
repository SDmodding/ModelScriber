To use this script you need to have in this folder:
- [ModelScriber.exe](https://github.com/SDmodding/ModelScriber/releases)
- [TextureScriberPC64.exe](https://github.com/SDmodding/TextureScriber/releases)

If you have everything in the folder then open command line in that folder.
Usage is simple:
    Scribe [Model name] [Path (Optional)] [Texture (Optional)]

Example usage for the example model if there was any:
    Scribe Example

    - If you run that script above with the params and have valid obj file and texture file it scribe model & texture under:
        Data\ExampleModel\...

Example usage for shared texture:
    Scribe Example \ Example
