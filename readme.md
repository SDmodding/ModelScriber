# ModelScriber
This is still under development and might be for some long time.

Main purpose of this project is to been able to scribe own model and then load it inside game as additional model, this means this project can't be used as purpose for changing models in actual game besides manually hex-editing pre-existing game model and manually changing Indexbuffer/Vertexbuffer/UVN Buffer.
